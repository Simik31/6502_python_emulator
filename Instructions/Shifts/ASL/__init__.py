"""
This operation shifts all the bits of the accumulator or memory contents one bit left.
Bit 0 is set to 0 and bit 7 is placed in the carry flag.
The effect of this operation is to multiply the memory contents by 2 (ignoring 2's complement considerations),
setting the carry if the result will not fit in 8 bits.
